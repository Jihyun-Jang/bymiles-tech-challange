## Project overview

create a simple web application with a login screen which takes a username and password. Once authorised, it will navigate the user to another page which will display policy details.


## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start` to run the server
4. Run `npm test` to run the tests

## Notes

- Used React. Jest and React testing library
- The app makes two different HTTP requests to get an authorization response and a policy information response
- Made the app look exactly like the given wireframe since further development was not expected
- Spent approx. 6 hours
